## Techsupport

This app allows users to create Zendesk tickets with secure contents. It presents a custom form for entering the ticket fields, and keeps the form data in a local database rather than sending it to the Zendesk cloud. People viewing the tickets can see the secure information, which stays within the company's firewall.
